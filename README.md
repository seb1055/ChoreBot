# ChoreBot

This Python program will send sms through Twillo to my roommates. The message will contain chores that are to be completed weekly and others that are to be completed regularly. After the person has completed the chore they can respond and a verifcation request will be sent to the other roommate to verify the chore has been done. If the chore was not completed by the end of the day an additional chore will be assigned.

**Chorebot now Supports Images
  When confirming you chore you can attach an image to be distrubuted as proof to your roommates.
